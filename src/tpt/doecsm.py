"""
Resamples 3D seismic images from DOE coordinates to CSM coordinates.
Resampling includes translation and rotation, in addition to changing
spatial sampling intervals. The translation and rotation better aligns
the (x2,x3) axes with the predominant strike and dip of geologic 
structures apparent in the images.
